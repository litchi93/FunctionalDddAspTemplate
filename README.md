Clean/Onion project layout using FunctionalDDD library

In the context of functional Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the layers can be understood as follows:

1. API Layer: The API layer in functional DDD acts as the entry point for external clients to interact with the system. It exposes endpoints that allow clients to send requests and receive responses. In this layer, the focus is on defining the API routes, handling requests, and serializing/deserializing data. It is responsible for translating incoming requests into domain-specific concepts and delegating the processing to the application layer.

2. Application Layer: The application layer, also known as the service layer, coordinates the execution of use cases or business processes. It contains application-specific logic that combines different domain concepts to fulfill specific operations or workflows. The application layer orchestrates the interactions between the API layer and the domain layer, applying business rules and ensuring the integrity and consistency of the system's behavior.

3. Domain Layer: The domain layer represents the heart of the system and encapsulates the core domain concepts, business rules, and behavior. It contains the domain models or entities that reflect the essential elements of the problem domain. In functional DDD, the domain models are typically immutable data structures or pure functions that model the state and behavior of the domain. The domain layer focuses on expressing the domain concepts in a clear and concise manner, independent of any specific implementation or infrastructure concerns.

4. Infrastructure Layer: The infrastructure layer deals with technical aspects and external dependencies required for the system to function. It includes components such as databases, external services, file systems, and other infrastructure-related code. In functional DDD, the infrastructure layer provides implementations of interfaces defined in the domain layer, enabling the application to interact with external systems and manage persistence and other infrastructure concerns.

The goal of this layered approach in functional DDD is to isolate and separate concerns, making the system more modular and easier to reason about. Each layer has a specific responsibility and should adhere to the principles of functional programming, such as immutability, referential transparency, and avoiding side effects, where applicable.

It's important to note that functional DDD may have some differences in implementation compared to traditional object-oriented DDD, as it leverages functional programming paradigms and immutable data structures. The core principles of DDD, such as understanding the domain, modeling concepts, and emphasizing business value, still apply, but the technical implementation details may differ.
